## Initialize project with npm init
  Heavier Install // Lighter Yarn
  npm init        // yarn init

  Check package.json      // yarn
  Check package.npm.json

### Adding Dependencies: Nodemon, Live-Server

  Check npmjs.com 
  check last updated
  check weekly downloads
  check number of open issues

  local vs global packages (development only)
  Some dependencies are for development only (not during production), e.g., nodemon
